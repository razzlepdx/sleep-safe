# Setup

Follow these steps to successfully run this app on your machine!

## 1. Requirements

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

    Check that it installed correctly:

      ```
      which git
      ```

    If Git is installed, this will return the path `/usr/local/bin/git`  
    If you get an error message, check the Git documentation and   
    try again.
    
    
2. Install Python 3.

    - <b>Any OS: </b>use a downloadable installer for any operating system: https://www.python.org/downloads/

    - <b>macOS</b> using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

        ```sh
        brew install python3
        ```

    - <b>Windows</b> using [Scoop](http://scoop.sh/):

        ```sh
        scoop install python3
        ```

    - Once installed, verify that it's installed correctly:

        ```
        which python3
        ```

        If installed, this will return the path `/usr/local/bin/python3`


## 2. Download the project

1. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/razzlepdx/sleep-safe)

2. Clone the git repository to your machine

      ```
      git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/sleep-safe.git
      ```

3. Move into that repository

      ```
      cd sleep-safe
      ```

## 3. Set up development environment

1. Create a [Python Virtual Environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    Enter the newly created virtual environment:
    
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Note: for Windows users, the path to activate your virtual environment will likely be `source venv/Scripts/activate`

2. Install dependencies from the Sleep Safe requirements.txt file

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Setup a local mySQL database using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)

    - Select the download for your OS (MAMP, <b>not</b> MAMP Pro)
  
    - Open MAMP, and press the Start Servers button. This should open the MAMP WebStart page in your web browser. 

    - Create a new user account and database through phpMyAdmin, found in the Tools menu.

        ![MAMP new user](./assets/mamp_new_user.png)

    - Make sure your username and password are exactly:

      - username: sleep-safe
      - password: sleep-safe

## 4. Run the app

1. From the virtual environment created in step 3, run:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

    The app will now be running in your browser at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
